Overview
The notebook is divided into two main parts:

Part I: Image Classification (60 marks)
In this section, students are required to:

Build and train a deep learning model for image classification.

Choose an appropriate architecture that can effectively learn from the dataset (e.g., CNNs like ResNet, VGG, etc.).

Perform data loading and preprocessing (likely using OpenCV, PIL, or torchvision).

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).

Provide analysis of the modelâ€™s performance and learning behaviour.

Part II: (To be confirmed in later cells)
Based on previous module structure, the second part may involve tasks such as:

Image captioning using RNNs or transformers.

Multi-modal learning tasks involving both vision and language.
